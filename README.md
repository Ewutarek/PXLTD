## Why did I make this?
I made this as my final project for the Tech Talent Accelerator Course. It was great way to show off my progress in technical acccumen but also integrate
my interest in creative computing.
 The main library used was p5.js, which is specifically built for creative computing. I aslo used the typewiter.jsfor the cool typing effect.
